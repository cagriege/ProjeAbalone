Introduction
What is an abalone? From Wikipedia, an abalone is a common name for any of a group of small to very large sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Haliotidae. Determining the age of abalone is typically time consuming - requiring cutting the shell, staining it, then counting the number of rings with a microscope. We want to see if physical measurements can be used to predict the age.
